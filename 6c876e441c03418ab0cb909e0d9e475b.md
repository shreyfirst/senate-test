## CHAPTER ONE

> **DEFINITION AND ADOPTION OF BYLAWS**

100. #### DEFINITION OF BYLAWS

     A.  The ASUCD Bylaws serve to define the rules of order directly
         > concerning the operation and duties of the ASUCD Senate, the
         > subordinate bodies of the ASUCD Senate and all other ASUCD
         > entities. The ASUCD Bylaws also outline the policies and
         > procedures concerning the general operation of the ASUCD.

101. #### ADOPTION OF BYLAWS

     A.  The ASUCD Senate and its subordinate bodies shall consider the
         > ASUCD Bylaws as adopted at every meeting. A Senate Bill
         > passed by a majority vote of the entire ASUCD Senate may
         > amend the ASUCD Bylaws. The ASUCD Senate shall consider all
         > Bylaws that deal with operations and practices of the ASUCD
         > outside of senate meetings as adopted, until such Bylaws are
         > amended or suspended by the ASUCD Senate.

102. #### BYLAW STRUCTURE

     A.  The ASUCD Bylaws shall not include any binary gender
         > references. All Bylaws shall not include any gender
         > references that may not be the preference of all members of
         > the ASUCD.

103. #### SUSPENSION

     A.  An ASUCD Bylaw(s) may be suspended for a particular purpose (to
         > be stated in conjunction with the motion) by a two-thirds (⅔)
         > majority vote of the entire Senate.

104. #### CONFLICTING BYLAWS

     A.  No ASUCD Bylaw is in order when it conflicts with the ASUCD
         > Constitution. In the event that two (2) or more Bylaws
         > conflict, the most recently adopted Bylaw(s) shall take
         > precedence over the older Bylaw(s). Members of the ASUCD must
         > report any conflicting Bylaws to the Internal Affairs
         > Commission immediately. If conflict exists or arises between
         > the ASUCD Bylaws and any relevant state or federal law, then
         > the state or federal law shall be checked and followed
         > without exception.

## CHAPTER TWO

> **CODE OF ETHICS**

200. #### INTRODUCTION 

     A.  Serving as an elected or appointed official of the Associated
         > Students of the University of California, Davis mandates the
         > responsibility to represent the students of the University of
         > California. Elements of this responsibility include:

         1.  Adhering to all university policies and the ASUCD governing
             > and procedural documents, as well as an obligation to
             > disclose knowledge of potential violations of these
             > policies and documents;

         2.  Refraining from interfering in the administration of the
             > ASUCD and its ability to function;

                 > require a two-thirds (⅔) majority vote of the entire

                 > meeting at which it is voted upon.

         5.  The author or their designee shall serve as an ex-officio,

503. #### CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION

     A.  **Consideration of legislation by the ASUCD Senate**

         1.  Any legislation reported as a noncontroversial bill by all
             > of the ASUCD Commission(s) to which it was sent shall be
             > placed on the ASUCD Consent Calendar of the next
             > regularly scheduled meeting of the ASUCD Senate if there
             > is no objection to do so from the author.

         2.  Any legislation that receives a recommendation of "Do
             > Pass," "Do Pass, as amended," or "No Recommendation" by
             > at least one-half (½) of the ASUCD Commission(s) to which
             > it was sent, shall be placed on the agenda of the next
             > regularly scheduled meeting of the ASUCD Senate. If a
             > commission authors legislation, their authoring vote
             > denotes a "Do Pass," and shall be included in the count
             > of recommendations.

         3.  Legislation that receives a recommendation of "Do Not Pass"
             > or "Do Not Pass, as amended" by more than one-half (½) of
             > the commission(s) to which it was sent may only be
             > considered by the Senate if revived by two-thirds (⅔)
             > majority vote of the entire ASUCD Senate within two (2)
             > weeks of receiving its final commission recommendation.
             > "Died/Killed in Commission" shall categorize any bill
             > which failed to pass a revival vote.

         4.  For the ASUCD Senate to consider a spending bill, the bill
             > must include the following:

             i.  An itemized budget: This must include specific costs
                 > for specific items and should include appropriate
                 > quotes, receipts, and a list of other sources of
                 > funding, when available. The itemized budget must
                 > also explicitly state funds that originate from the
                 > ASUCD General Fund with the term "ASUCD" and include
                 > a line item noting the total amount of ASUCD General
                 > Fund monies already allocated to the proposal.

             ii. A background: This shall include the overall intent
                 > behind the request of withdrawing funds from the
                 > ASUCD Senate Reserves. The background of a spending
                 > bill shall include, but is not limited to:

                 a.  Purpose: This shall include a description of the
                     > project.

                 b.  Parties: This shall include mentions of an
                     > individual, group(s), or campus organization(s)
                     > that are involved in the project.

                 c.  Timeline: In the case that a project is an event,
                     > this shall describe the immediate processes to
                     > take place if the money is allocated, including
                     > but not limited to:

                     1.  The expected date that the event shall take
                         > place;

                     2.  The individual(s) responsible for ensuring that
                         > the allocation of funds is properly
                         > disbursed;

                     3.  Expected attendance.

                 d.  Recurrence: This shall address whether the spending
                     > bill is a one-time request. If it is not, this
                     > shall describe how frequently this request is
                     > expected to be made.

         5.  A piece of legislation may be considered by the ASUCD
             > Senate during any regularly scheduled meeting as
             > "emergency" legislation pending a majority vote of the
             > entire ASUCD Senate and approval from the ASUCD Presiding
             > Officer, or by a two-thirds (⅔) majority vote of the
             > entire ASUCD Senate. Prior to the Senate voting on
             > whether to consider legislation as an "emergency," the
             > author(s) shall have no more than one (1) minute to
             > present reasons for the urgency of the legislation.

             i.  "Emergency" legislation shall be defined as "a serious
                 > and unexpected situation" in need of immediate action
                 > that directly affects students of the University of
                 > California, Davis.

             ii. Only two (2) pieces of "emergency" legislation may be
                 > seen during each individual Senate meeting. The ASUCD
                 > Senate shall consider emergency legislation from an
                 > individual senator no more than once every quarter.

             iii. To ensure transparency, when "emergency legislation"
                  > gets introduced to the Senate, senators must submit
                  > "emergency" legislation to the ASUCD Presiding
                  > Officer and SGAO before their office closes every
                  > Thursday. For any "emergency" legislation submitted
                  > past the Thursday deadline, senators shall send the
                  > legislation to the ASUCD Presiding Officer, who
                  > shall make the legislation available to anyone who
                  > requests it.

             iv. In the event that more than two (2) pieces of
                 > "emergency" legislation are submitted in a single
                 > senate meeting, the discretion of which two (2)
                 > pieces of legislation are to be seen is up to a vote
                 > of the ASUCD Senate.

             v.  The ASUCD Internal Vice President shall maintain a
                 > record of the ASUCD Senators as they introduce
                 > "emergency" legislation throughout the quarter and
                 > ensure that they do not exceed the maximum specified
                 > in this chapter.

         6.  The ASUCD Senate may reconsider any legislation vetoed by
             > the ASUCD President no later than the adjournment of the
             > second (2nd) Senate meeting after the legislation
             > originally passed the senate. The President shall submit
             > the ASUCD President's rationale for the veto on
             > legislation (not to exceed two (2) pages) to the Senate,
             > to be presented with the legislation when the Senate
             > reconsiders it. The ASUCD Senate President Pro Tempore
             > shall inform the Senate at the beginning of \"Status of
             > Legislation Previously Passed" on the status of bills
             > passed the previous week.

             i.  The ASUCD President or designee shall inform the author
                 > of the bill of the veto prior to the ASUCD Senate
                 > meeting, at which the ASUCD Senate may reconsider it.

             ii. The vetoed bill shall be attached to the ASUCD Senate
                 > Agenda.

     B.  **Consideration of legislation by subordinate bodies of the
         > ASUCD Senate**

         1.  Each ASUCD Commission Chairperson shall ensure that
             > legislation is distributed to their respective commission
             > prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting.

         2.  All subordinate bodies of the ASUCD Senate shall consider
             > legislation at the first meeting after the legislation
             > was placed on the agenda of the subordinate body for its
             > consideration, unless the author or the author's designee
             > is not present to speak on behalf of the legislation and
             > answer questions. If the author or the author's designee
             > misses the second scheduled subordinate body meeting
             > after placing the legislation on its agenda, the
             > legislation shall be considered withdrawn by the author.

         3.  ASUCD Commissions shall make a formal recommendation to the
             > ASUCD Senate in one (1) of the following manners:  "Do
             > Pass," "Do Pass, as amended," "No Recommendation," "Do
             > Not Pass," or "Do Not Pass, as amended." Legislation must
             > receive a majority vote of the entire ASUCD Commission to
             > receive a "Do Pass," or "Do Pass, as amended," a tie vote
             > shall result in a "No Recommendation."  An ASUCD Senate
             > Bill that allocates ASUCD monies requires a two-thirds
             > (⅔) majority vote of the entire commission to receive a
             > "Do Pass" or "Do Pass, as amended". An ASUCD Senate Bill
             > which allocates ASUCD monies and receives a vote less
             > than a two-thirds (⅔) majority vote of the entire
             > commission shall receive a "Do Not Pass," or a "Do Not
             > Pass, as amended."

             i.  Only those members in attendance for the discussion of
                 > a piece of legislation may cast a vote on that
                 > particular piece of legislation. If the chairperson
                 > of a commission determines that a member was absent
                 > for a significant aspect or duration of the
                 > discussion on a particular piece of legislation, that
                 > member's vote shall be counted as an abstention. If
                 > an appropriate alternate member of the commission was
                 > present for the discussion, they may cast a vote for
                 > the voting member, as though the voting member is
                 > still absent (see chapter on the Subordinate Bodies
                 > of the Senate).

             ii. All other subordinate bodies of the ASUCD Senate must
                 > make informal recommendations to the ASUCD Senate in
                 > the exact same manner.

             iii. A subordinate body of the ASUCD Senate may, by a
                  > majority vote of the entire body, table (choose not
                  > to consider) a piece of legislation until the next
                  > regularly scheduled meeting of that body unless the
                  > Senate votes to consider it urgent. Tabling
                  > legislation for a second (2nd) week shall result in
                  > a \"No Recommendation\" recommendation.

             iv. When the ASUCD Senate assigns legislation to more than
                 > one (1) of its subordinate bodies, then the
                 > legislation may be considered at each within the same
                 > week; no two (2) commissions shall consider the same
                 > piece of legislation on the same day.

         4.  For any ASUCD Commission to consider a spending bill, the
             > bill must include all components necessary for
             > consideration by the ASUCD Senate.

         5.  Each subordinate body of the ASUCD Senate to which the
             > ASUCD Senate referred a piece of legislation shall report
             > its recommendation and outcome of votes taken on the
             > legislation to the ASUCD Senate no later than the second
             > (2nd) regularly scheduled ASUCD Senate meeting after the
             > legislation was placed on the agenda of the subordinate
             > body for its consideration. If a commission fails to
             > report legislation by then, the legislation shallbe given
             > a "No Recommendation" by that subordinate body. The ASUCD
             > Senate may, at any time, by a majority vote of the entire
             > senate, grant a subordinate body one (1) time extension,
             > not to exceed two (2) weeks, for the consideration of a
             > particular piece of legislation.

         6.  After the adoption of any amendments made in the commission
             > process, any bill reported as a noncontroversial bill by
             > all relevant commission chairs shall be placed by the
             > ASUCD Internal Vice President on the ASUCD Consent
             > Calendar, and shall be known as a "Consent Calendar bill"
             > if there is no objection to do so from the author.

     C.  **Actions by the ASUCD Senate**

         1.  The ASUCD Senate may table (choose not to consider) a piece
             > of legislation and place it on the agenda of the next
             > regularly scheduled ASUCD Senate meeting by a majority
             > vote of the entire ASUCD Senate.

         2.  At any time the ASUCD Senate may refer or remove a referral
             > of any legislation to any subordinate body of the ASUCD
             > Senate by a majority vote of the entire ASUCD Senate.

         3.  The ASUCD Senate must remove a bill from the ASUCD Consent
             > Calendar if (a) the bill amends during a senate meeting
             > or (b) a senator or commission chair objects to the
             > bill's placement on the ASUCD Consent Calendar. Any bill
             > removed from the ASUCD Consent Calendar shall be
             > considered as regular legislation in the same meeting.

         4.  The ASUCD Senate may pass any piece of legislation or all
             > bills in the ASUCD Consent Calendar by a majority vote of
             > the entire ASUCD Senate. Any Senate Bill that allocates
             > ASUCD monies from the ASUCD Senate Reserve, Capital
             > Reserve, or Technology Reserve, or adopts or revises the
             > ASUCD Annual Budget may only be passed by a two-thirds
             > (⅔) majority vote of the entire ASUCD Senate. Any ASUCD
             > Senate Bill that places an ASUCD Ballot Measure before a
             > vote of the ASUCD membership must be passed in accordance
             > with the Chapter on the Elections Code.

         5.  Abstentions shall be recorded as either absences or present

             > after the number of each type.

         6.  All legislation shall take effect immediately upon
             > enactment (by signature of the ASUCD President or the
             > equivalent form of an enactment specified elsewhere in
             > the ASUCD Bylaws or ASUCD Constitution) unless otherwise
             > specified in the legislation. If the ASUCD President does
             > not sign or veto the legislation within a week of its

1405. #### BALLOTS, VOTING, AND TABULATION 

      A.  **Ballots**

          1.  In the event that a Recall or ballot measure is placed on
              > a ballot, the measures shall be listed before the
              > candidate listings.

          2.  The listing of candidates or tickets for the same office
              > on the ballot shall be randomly generated by a computer
              > program for each iteration of the ballot.

          3.  Ballots shall ask the voters to rank the candidates they
              > support in order of preference, with "1" or \"1st\"
              > being the highest/most preferred. Voters may rank as
              > many or as few candidates as they wish. Ballot
              > instructions shall include a statement expressing the
              > following idea to voters: "You do not hurt the chances
              > of your higher-ranked candidates by ranking additional
              > candidates."

      B.  **Voting Procedures**

          1.  Only current undergraduate members of the ASUCD may vote
              > in any ASUCD Election.

          2.  No voter may cast more than one (1) ballot in any ASUCD
              > Election.

          3.  Any difficulties experienced while voting or suspected
              > fraud should be reported to the Elections Committee.

          4.  Members of ASUCD may only cast their ballot on the
              > official ASUCD Elections website.

      C.  **Tabulation**

          1.  The Elections Committee shall oversee the tabulation of
              > votes cast in every ASUCD Election held under the
              > authority of the ASUCD Constitution and this chapter of
              > the ASUCD Bylaws. The tabulation method, as stated in
              > the ASUCD Constitution, shall be as follows:

              i.  Pursuant to the ASUCD Constitution, instant runoff
                  > voting (IRV) shall be used to elect the ASUCD
                  > President and Internal Vice President.

                  a.  In instant runoff voting, the tabulation of votes
                      > proceeds in rounds. In each round, a value of
                      > one (1) vote is assigned to each voter's highest
                      > remaining preference. For a ticket to be
                      > elected, the required number of votes is a
                      > majority of the votes in that round. If a
                      > voter's preference is for a ticket with the
                      > lowest accrued vote total, that ticket is
                      > eliminated, and the vote is transferred to the
                      > next preferred ticket still in the running. This
                      > process is completed when one (1) ticket
                      > receives the required majority of votes.

              ii. Pursuant to the ASUCD Constitution, single
                  > transferable voting (STV) shall be used to elect the
                  > ASUCD Senators. Fractional transfer shall be used in
                  > this tabulation.

                  a.  In single transferable voting with fractional
                      > transfer, the value of one (1) vote is assigned
                      > to each voter's first preference. The quota for
                      > the election is the smallest number of votes
                      > necessary to elect the required number of
                      > candidates. A candidate is elected to a seat if
                      > that candidate has accrued a quota of the votes
                      > or if no surplus candidates remain. If a voter's
                      > current preference is for a candidate who has
                      > received more than the quota for votes, the
                      > surplus value of that voter's vote shall be
                      > transferred to that voter's next eligible
                      > preference based on the proportion of the total
                      > votes accrued by that candidate. If a voter's
                      > current preference is for a candidate eliminated
                      > or already elected, the current value of the
                      > vote shall be transferred to the voter's next
                      > eligible preference.

                  b.  In the event that two (2) senate candidates have
                      > the same amount of votes for the last available
                      > senate seat, the candidate with the most votes
                      > in the first (1st) round shall be declared the
                      > winner. If there is also an equal number of
                      > votes in the first (1st) round between the
                      > two (2) tied candidates, the candidate with the
                      > most votes in the proceeding round shall be
                      > declared the winner of the last available senate
                      > seat.

              iii. Pursuant to the ASUCD Constitution, instant runoff
                   > voting (IRV) shall be used to elect the ASUCD
                   > Student Advocate, the ASUCD External Affairs Vice
                   > President, the ASUCD Transfer Student
                   > Representative, and the ASUCD International Student
                   > Representative.

                   a.  In instant runoff voting, the tabulation of votes
                       > proceeds in rounds. In each round, a value of
                       > one (1) vote is assigned to each voter's
                       > highest remaining preference. For the Student
                       > Advocate, EAVP, TSR, or ISR to be elected, the
                       > required number of votes is a majority of the
                       > votes in that round. If a voter's preference is
                       > for the candidate with the lowest accrued vote
                       > total, that candidate is eliminated, and the
                       > vote is transferred to the next preferred
                       > candidate still in the running. This process is
                       > completed when one (1) ticket receives the
                       > required majority of votes.

          2.  Creative Media and the Elections Committee shall maintain
              > a permanent website that includes an explanation of the
              > instant runoff voting and single transferable voting
              > systems used in ASUCD Elections. This website shall also
              > include a complete description of the algorithms that
              > shall be used to tabulate the votes and/or the name of
              > any software that shall be used to carry out the
              > algorithm. Any changes to the tabulation process must be
              > made on the website at least four (4) weeks prior to an
              > election.

          3.  Pursuant to Article III of the ASUCD Constitution, the
              > Elections Committee shall authorize the public release
              > of the ballot ranking data the same day that the results
              > of the vote tally are announced so that independent
              > verification of the vote tally may be performed.

          > automatically terminates. All stipend positions within ASUCD

          > Bylaws, hourly positions should be hired indefinitely unless
          > the employee is to be hired for a specific amount of time.

          > position receives a specific wage for each hour of work
          > performed.

      E.  **Stipend positions:** A monetary stipend is provided for some
          > positions to partially compensate a person for time and

              > that do not fit into the concept of the Assistant Series

          > part of a financial aid award and departments to employ
          > students at a reduced rate. The department pays only a
          > portion of the Work-Study employee's wages, with the
          > remaining portion paid by federal funds up to the amount of

              > judgment of the hiring authority, possesses the
              > qualifications required to perform the duties of the
              > position most effectively is to be selected for the
              > position.\" (Personnel Policy for Staff Members 21 A.)

          2.  When considering applicants with similar qualifications,
              > the highest hiring priority for ASUCD jobs shall be
              > given to currently enrolled undergraduate students and
              > undergraduate students in the Planned Educational Leave
              > Program (PELP). Graduate students shall be given the
              > next priority in hiring. Positions are open to non-UC
              > Davis students only if reasonable efforts have failed to
              > identify qualified student applicants.

      B.  **Selection Procedures**

          1.  **Applications:** After a position is closed for
              > recruitment, all applications are given to the Activity
              > Manager or other hiring authority (person who is
              > authorized to hire for that position). This person must
              > retain the original applications of all applicants for

                      > members who have the hiring authority and if the
                      > role of the committee is advisory. The rationale
                      > for this procedure is to clarify who is

          > through CFC, and the organization finds it necessary to
          > immediately address the issue.

              > success of the event; or

          2.  There are scheduling conflicts with other campus
              > programming events that may be detrimental to all
              > events; or

          3.  The ASUCD Business Manager, ASUCD Controller, or the ASUCD
              > Programming Unit Director feel that the Student
              > Organization may be unable to bear its share of the
              > financial burden should the event end up with a net
              > loss; or

          4.  The event is eligible to receive a grant from Cultural
              > Days; or

              > before requesting funding or co-sponsorship from any
              > Unit or program of ASUCD including the Senate.
